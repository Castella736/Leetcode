# [1685. Sum of Absolute Differences in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-absolute-differences-in-a-sorted-array/description/)

# Intuition
We can use some elementary Math to simply the problem. Since the list of number is nondecreasing, we may split the sum of absolute values into two parts: one is summing over those $j$ which are less than $i$, the other is over those $j$ which are greater than $i$.

After that, it can be seen that we can use pre-sum method to build the code.
# Approach
$$
    \sum\limits_{j\neq i}|x_j-x_i| \\
    = \sum\limits_{j<i}x_i-x_j + \sum\limits_{j>i}x_i-x_j \\
    = x_i (i - (n-1-i)) + \sum\limits_{j\neq i} x_j - 2\sum_{j<i} x_j \\
    = x_i(2i-n) + \sum_{j} x_j - 2\sum_{j<i} x_j.
$$
That is the value we are going to append for index $i$. We can simply calculate the later summations with a pre-sum variable.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
To use presum, we will need to traverse the data for once to sum all numbers, this takes $n$ time. We load numbers again in the main calculation loop, also takes $n$ time. So it's a 2-pass algorithm. Overall complexity is $n$.

- **Space complexity**: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
Obviously constant space used.
# Code
```Python
class Solution:
    def getSumAbsoluteDifferences(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Since x_i is non-decreasing, for 0-indexed x_j
        # sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-x_j| = x_i(2i-n) + sum_j x_j - 2 sum_{j<i} x_j.
        # Use pre_sum to calculate it.
        pre_sum = sum(nums);
        n = len(nums);
        res = [];
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            res.append(
                (2*i - n) * num + pre_sum
            );
            pre_sum -= 2 * num;
            
        return res;
```
