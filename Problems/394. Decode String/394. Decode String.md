# [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/)

# Solution
1. Use a `stack` to store verified element.
2. Upon finding `"]"`, trigger a **decoding process** to the top **segment** of the `stack`.
   - The segment is of the form `"num_part[char_part]"`, for example:`"2[bdc]"`. The `num_part` of it is `2` and the `char_part` is `"bdc"`.
3. The decoding process send a segment to a string `"char_part" * num_part`.
4. Remove the top segment of `stack` and attach the decoded result to the stack.
5. Continue the process until the end.
6. Convert `stack` into `str` then return it.

# Note
- I treat the input string as a list and use list to implement `track` due to simplicity. To convert `track` to string, we can use the **method** `str.join(stack)`.
  ```Python
    stack  =["a","e","a","e","c"];
    "".join(stack);
    # => "aeaec".
  ```
