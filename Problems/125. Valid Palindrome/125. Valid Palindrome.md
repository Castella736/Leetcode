# [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/)

A phrase is a **palindrome**  if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a **palindrome** , or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

## Symbols

- $s$ : the string `s`
- $n$ : length of $s$


## Two-pointers

Using regular left-right pointer to traverse the string. Advance to the next if the character is not ascii alpha-numeric. If both of them are ascii-numeric, compare if they are equal in lowercase. Return `False` if not and continue the loop otherwise. Continue the loop until to pointers meets.

### Code

```Python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Track left and right characters.
        l, r = 0, len(s)-1;
        alphanumeric = string.ascii_letters+"1234567890";
        
        # While two pointers not meet yet.
        while l < r:
            # Skip if not alpha-numeric ascii char.
            if not s[l] in alphanumeric:
                l += 1;
                continue; # Re-check if meet.
            if not s[r] in alphanumeric:
                r -= 1;
                continue;
            
            # Return False if two letter not the same in lowercase
            if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False;
            # Advance to next.
            l += 1;
            r -= 1;
        
        # Return True if it pass all verifications.
        return True;
```

### Analysis

The string `s` is travesed only 1 time. And each element in `s` is load twice from memory. So there are totally about $4n$ operations. Thus the 

- Time complexity : $\mathcal{O}(n)$

And obviously

- Space complexity : $\mathcal{O}(1)$

### Misc

- We can also use a `string` method call `isalnum` to check if a character is alpha-numeric

## Pre-process, Reverse and Compare

- Remove all non-alpha-numeric characters in $s$ first.
- Reverse $s$ and compare it with origion string.

### Code

```
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, s)).lower();
        return s==s[::-1];
```

### Analysis

`s` will be travesed twice and each element will be load 3 times. But base on the code, we load whole `s` into extra memory (the `join` part). So

- Time complexity : $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space complexity : $\mathcal{O}(n)$

### Misc

This code looks more Pythonic than previous one and use less conditional statements which enable it run faster. But it takes extra memory, so I don't really like it.
