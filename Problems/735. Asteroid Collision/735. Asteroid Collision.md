# [735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/submissions/1090599782/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

**tags :** `Array`, `Stack`, `Simulation`

## Explaination
See the [content](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/submissions/1090599782/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75).

## Solution
We build a stack and put first element in it. Then continue the following: traverse the list and do the simulation. The simulation is comparing the next element with top of stack. Then simulate the collision until it stop.

### Notations
- $n$: number of asteroids
- `track`: the stack, the last element is the last seen element, denote it by *top*
- `newAsteroid`: the current tracked asteroid.

### Algorithm

For each element in the list, we perform the following to simulate collision of `top` and `newAsteroid`. It can be proved that the order of simulation of collisions does not affect the result.

1. Check if they will collide.
   1. If collision happens, destroy one or both of them depending on their size. Pop `top` and re-check again.
   2. Append `newAsteriod` otherwise.
2. Advance to the next `newAsteriod`.

### Notes
- Due to the context, the collision happens only when $\mathrm{top}>0$ and $\mathrm{newAsteroid}$.
- To check size of two, it is equivalent to compare $\mathrm{top}$ and $\mathrm{newAsteroid}$.

## Complexity
- Time: each element in $\mathrm{track}$ is compared at most twice and the length of it is less or equal to $n$. So the complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
- Space: obviously $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
