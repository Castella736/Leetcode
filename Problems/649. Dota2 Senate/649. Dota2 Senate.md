[649. Dota2 Senate](https://leetcode.com/problems/dota2-senate/description/)

- This can be solved by using two queue to simulate the process, which store orders of senates (in `int`) to indicate the priority of senates.
- Note that although it says the vote conducts in rounds, it is acctually can be implemented in **one loop** by adding the number of remaining senates to the element of the queues.

- **Issue**: Since we add length of queue to the elements in the queue during the process, there may occur overflow. To solve this, one can use extra two queues to simulate the round, or minus all numbers by the smallest number in union of two queues.
