# [2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/description/)

- Let the size be $n$, the index ($0$-base) of middle node is `n//2`.
- I used **fast-slow two-pointers** to solve this. While the fast pointer reach the end, the slow pointer will point approximately middle node.
  The main code is
  ```Python
  fast, slow = head.next, head;
  while fast.next and fast.next.next:
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  ```
- With the above algorithm, the fast pointer ends at index $1+2k<=n-1$ and at that time, the slow pointer is at $k$.
  - If $n$ even
    $$
        1+2k = n-1\\
        n = 2k+2\\
        n//2 = k+1.
    $$
    So the node to be removed is index $k+1$.
  - If $n$ even
    $$
        1+2k = n-1 -1 = n-2\\
        n = 2k+3\\
        n//2 = k+1.
    $$
    So it is also $k+1$.
- Connecting `slow` to `slow.next.next` gets the result.
