# [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/description/)

One method is to sort the array and return the $k$-th number counted from the back. This is a $n\log(n)$ time solution.

Anothor method is to maintain a min heap of length $k$, denoted by `heap`. For `num` in `nums` we add it to `heap` if the length of heap is less than $k$ or `num` is larger than `heap[0]`, the smallest element in the heap. From this construction, `heap` will consist of $k$ largest elements in the array.
