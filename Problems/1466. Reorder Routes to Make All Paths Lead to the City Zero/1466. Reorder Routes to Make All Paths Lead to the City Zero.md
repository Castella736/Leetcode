[1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/description/)

## Solution 1-1: DFS - Using Recursion
This approach first transform the raw data into a adjacent list to present the tree. Then use DFS (deep first search) implemented with recursion to record the sum.

The adjacent list is of the form
```
adj[i] = [(j_1,d_1), (j_2, d_2) ...]
```
`i` means the position of the start node and `j` means the end node and `d` indicates the direction. **Through the construction, we will let `i` always be the position that is closer to `0` than `j`.** So `i`&rarr;`j` will alway the the reversed direction.

To do that, we start from `0` and always consider unseen nodes only through the DFS.

### Code
```Python
from collections import defaultdict;
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        res = 0; # Record result.
        seen = set(); # Record seen node.
        
        # Create adjacent list.
        # By construction, the index position always is the node to be pointed.
        # ele. in adj. is of the form adj[i][(j,d)], we always want
        # j -> i. Otherwise it is a reversed direction.
        # d means if the direction reversed, is 1 is reversed, 0 otherwise.
        adj = defaultdict(list);
        for side in connections:
            adj[side[0]].append((side[1], 1));
            adj[side[1]].append((side[0], 0));
        
        # Perform DFS until no new node found.
        def dfs(cur: int) -> None:
            nonlocal res, seen;
            seen.add(cur);
            # Search next unseen node.
            for next, re_dir in adj[cur]:
                if next not in seen:
                    res += re_dir;
                    dfs(next);
            
            return;
        
        # Start search from the root 0.
        dfs(0);
        
        return res;
```

### Misc
- `defaultdict` gives a simpler initialization of the `adj` list.
- The `seen.add(cur)` should be written at start of the `dfs`, not in the `for`-loop in the end of `dfs` due to mechanism of recursion stack.

### Complexity

**Time:** The complexity of transforming to `adj` is obviously $\mathcal{O}(n)$. As the form of `adj`, each node will be looked only once which will contribute one visit for each side adjacent to the node (by the `for`-loop). So each side will be considered at most twice. That is $\mathcal{O}(n)$. So the overall time complexity is 
- $\mathcal{O}(n)$

**Space:** The `adj` list takes $2n$ space. And the recursion takes about $n$. `seen` also takes `n`. So overall
- $\mathcal{O}(n)$

## Solution 1-2: DFS - Using Stack

Not too much difference than previous, but use stack to implement DFS other than using recursion. Slightly better performance than previous one.

### Code
```Python
from collections import defaultdict, deque;
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        res = 0; # Record result.
        seen = {0}; # Record seen node.
        stack = deque([0]); # Stack for DFS.
        
        # Create adjacent list.
        # By construction, the index position always is the node to be pointed.
        # ele. in adj. is of the form adj[i][(j,d)], we always want
        # j -> i. Otherwise it is a reversed direction.
        # d means if the direction reversed, is 1 is reversed, 0 otherwise.
        adj = defaultdict(list);
        for side in connections:
            adj[side[0]].append((side[1], 1));
            adj[side[1]].append((side[0], 0));
        
        # Perform DFS until no new node found.
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop();
            seen.add(cur);
            
            for next, re_dir in adj[cur]:
                if next not in seen:
                    stack.append(next);
                    res += re_dir;

        return res;
```

## Complexity

The same as previous one.

## Solution 2: Simple Stack

Fun easy method but not good in performance. Since it may pop and append elements repeatly which may cause slowness.

```Python
from collections import deque;
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        queue = deque(connections);
        seen = {0};
        res = 0;
        
        # We can view all seen nodes as an integrity, view it as the node 0.
        # Use this to determine if the direction is reversed if
        # one of the node had been seen.
        # Postpone the pair if all unseen.
        while queue:
            start, toward = queue.popleft();
            
            if toward in seen:
                seen.add(start);
            elif start in seen:
                res += 1;
                seen.add(toward);
            else:
                queue.append([start, toward]);
        
        return res;
```
