# [1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-positions-in-a-binary-matrix/description/)

Let's make some definitions.

For an index $(i,j)$ of a matrix $M$,
- if is *row-special* if $M_{i,j}$ is the only $1$ in that row.
- if is *col-special* if $M_{i,j}$ is the only $1$ in that column.

Then a index $(i,j)$ of a matrix $m$ if and only if the index is row-special and col-special for $M$.

It is straight forward to find all row-special and col-special indexes through two 1-pass traversals. We store found indexed in two sets. Then return the size of intersection of the two sets.

Adding element into a set requires constant time. So the 1-pass traversal will require $n\cdotm$ time. Finding size of intersection of two sets require time proportional to min. of size of two sets, which is comparably less than $\min(n, m)$.

Overall complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n\cdotm)$.
Space complexity is $\mathcal(\max(n,m))$.

For today's daily. Note that a index is special if both the index is the only "1" in the row and column respectively. Let's call those *row-special* and *col-special* respectively. Then the problem can be broken down to find all col-special index that is row-special. This can be easily done through 2-pass traversal. But I find it is difficult to find a 1-pass solution.
